# Overview

Hello! I am D. Jane Orr, a Software Engineering student. I am excited to start on my portfolio, and what better way to do it than to create a "Hello World" demo?

This demo is to show how simple coding can be, wher you only have one line of code. 

The purpose of this software is to start my portfolio, as most Computer Science majors do, in order to showcase our programming skills.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to make this project.

I used Python to make this project, as it is the language I am most proficient in.
